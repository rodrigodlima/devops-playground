# Visual Studio Code Dev Containers
The Dev Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. Whether you deploy to containers or not, containers make a great development environment because you can:

Develop with a consistent, easily reproducible toolchain on the same operating system you deploy to.
Quickly swap between different, separate development environments and safely make updates without worrying about impacting your local machine.
Make it easy for new team members / contributors to get up and running in a consistent development environment.
Try out new technologies or clone a copy of a code base without impacting your local setup.
